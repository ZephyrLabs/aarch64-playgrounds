# aarch64-playgrounds
Just a bunch of hand crafted experiments to tinker with the
capabilities of a really fast aarch64 based system.

![neofetch!](/images/neofetch.png "neofetch")

**SoC:** RK3588s
* 4x ARM Cortex A76 (ARMv8.4-a)
* 4x ARM Cortex A55 (ARMv8.2-a)
* Mali G610-mp4 GPU (with OpenCL support)

mostly just trying to make the most out of computation acceleration
capabilities provided with cutting edge hardware..
